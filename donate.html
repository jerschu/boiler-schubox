First,
we would like to thank you for using this site. 
As this project is getting started we are just adding notes, studyguides, and other study resources.
As this project continues to grow and gain support we have plans to grow and improve like:
<ul>
<li> Adding video resources to explain topics</li>
<li> Including a notecard feature to give you diffeernt ways to study </li>
<li> adding new practice problems that you can work through </li>
<li> Adding several common coding languages and several snippets of code </li>
</ul>
But these improvements will take a not of time and effort.
  To support this project we ask that you help donate to it so that we can grow and continue to help you learn.
  Think of this as a tutoring platform, one that you can use and continute to learn from
